JavaScript Calculator Using Higher-Order Functions
This project demonstrates the use of JavaScript higher-order functions by implementing a simple calculator in the browser console.

ðŸ“‚ Files Included
index.html â€” The HTML file that loads the JavaScript.

app.js â€” Contains various calculator functions using different JavaScript function types (named functions, anonymous functions, arrow functions, IIFEs).

ðŸ’» Features
Demonstrates:

Function expressions

Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE)

Arrow functions

Higher-order functions (passing functions as arguments)

Performs basic arithmetic:

Addition

Subtraction

Multiplication

Modulo

ðŸš€ How to Run
